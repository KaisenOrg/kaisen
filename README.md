> This README provides an overview of the Kaizen platform. For more detailed information about the application, please refer to the [wad.md](./documents/wad.md).

Kaisen proposes a new framework for acquiring and validating knowledge. It is a decentralized protocol that replaces the passive logic of content consumption with an active, intelligent, and community-driven learning experience.

Through the combination of artificial intelligence and collective curation, users build personalized learning paths, while the network itself validates and enhances the most effective routes to mastery. Individual progress is transparently recorded and recognized through NFT certificates, which securely, verifiably, and permanently attest to proficiency in specific skills.

More than just an educational platform, Kaisen lays the foundation for a decentralized, interoperable, and reputation-based knowledge infrastructure.

## Solution Overview

<div align="center">

<img src="./documents/assets/banner-home.png" width="100%">

</div>

The advancement of artificial intelligence has radically transformed access to knowledge. Tools like ChatGPT, YouTube, and online course platforms are empowering a new generation of autonomous learners ‚Äî a movement growing rapidly, as highlighted by HolonIQ reports.

However, this revolution faces a structural limitation: the lack of reliable mechanisms to authenticate learning acquired outside of traditional institutions.

Kaisen was created to bridge this gap. It combines artificial intelligence, collective curation, and decentralized infrastructure to transform individual learning journeys into verifiable records. Each path is built with AI support, validated by the community, and registered as NFT certificates that securely, auditably, and interoperably prove the real competencies acquired by each user.

## Core Features

<div align="center">

---

### Installation Guide

#### üíª Linux/macOS

1. Clone the repository and access the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaisenOrg/kaisen.git
cd kaisen
```
2. Grant permission to the script and run:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The script automatically performs the following steps:
> Tip: Run `dfx identity get-principal` to get your ID

- Creates the `env.mo` file with the provided data
- Requests your **Gemini API key**
- Starts DFX (`--background --clean`)
- Creates, compiles, generates, and deploys all canisters
- Requests your **ICP Principal ID**
- Deploys the `icrc1_ledger` canister with the correct parameters

#### ü™ü Windows (via WSL)

1. Install WSL 2 (Microsoft Official Guide)

2. Use Ubuntu 20.04+ from Microsoft Store

3. Open the WSL terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js 22.x
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs build-essential

# Install DFX (Internet Computer SDK)
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

# Install Git and dos2unix
sudo apt install git dos2unix

git clone https://github.com/KaisenOrg/kaisen.git
cd kaisen

# Fix line endings (required if inside /mnt/c/...)
dos2unix setup.sh

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: If you cloned the project in a Windows directory (e.g., /mnt/c/...), running `dos2unix setup.sh` is required to avoid execution errors like:
> -bash: ./setup.sh: cannot execute: required file not found

**Check:** Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:5173 to view the running app or enter the kaisen_frontend link returned by setup.sh.

### Data Storage Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏èThis project does not use a traditional relational database. All data storage is decentralized and handled through Internet Computer canisters.

#### üì¶ Storage Structure

- Canisters written in Motoko store persistent application state and logic.

- User data (tracks, certificates, tokens) is kept directly inside canisters and accessed via authenticated calls.

- Frontend communicates via @dfinity/agent using the Candid interface.

#### üîê Architecture Benefits

- **Fully decentralized:** No external databases or cloud servers required.

- **Automatic persistence:** Handled natively by the ICP protocol.

- **Built-in security:** Identity, isolation, and data integrity by design.

## System Architecture

<div align="center">

<img src="./documents/assets/architecture-banner.png" width="100%">

</div>

The diagram below provides a simplified overview of Kaizen‚Äôs architecture. Users interact with a modern interface built using React and Vite.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, and developed with TypeScript and JavaScript. This front-end layer communicates directly with canisters hosted on the Internet Computer (ICP), which serve as the decentralized back-end of the application. Additionally, these canisters integrate with external services such as the Gemini API to generate content through artificial intelligence, ensuring a dynamic and personalized experience.

## Conclusions and future work

<div align="center">

<img src="./documents/assets/history-banner.png" width="100%">

</div>

Kaizen is consolidating itself as a collaborative and decentralized learning platform, allowing users to explore and share knowledge openly and securely. To date, we have developed important features such as modular content organization, assistive chat, user profiles, and progress tracking.

During development, we faced challenges related to integrating with blockchain technology and ensuring a seamless user experience. However, these obstacles are designed to improve the platform's structure and usability.

For the next steps, our main goals include implementing a tokenized rewards system, which aims to encourage user engagement, and developing decentralized governance, allowing the community itself to participate in decisions regarding platform developments.

Another planned advancement is the introduction of the trail fork functionality. With this feature, users will be able to duplicate an existing trail, customize it according to their interests, and, if desired, contribute to the original trail. This strengthens collaboration, personalized learning, and a sense of belonging to the community.

Finally, we remain committed to continuous improvements in usability, accessibility, and integration with new technologies, making Kaizen increasingly efficient, inclusive, and relevant for all audiences.
