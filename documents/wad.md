# 1. Introduction

Kaisen is a decentralized educational platform that transforms the way people learn, gather, and validate knowledge. By integrating artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, the app offers an innovative and seamless experience where users not only study in a personalized way but also publicly demonstrate their progress through immutable digital certifications.

In practice, the process begins when users send content such as PDFs, notes, or articles directly to Kai—the platform's intelligent virtual assistant. From this material, Kai generates interactive flashcards, quizzes, summaries, and personalized study paths, facilitating targeted and efficient learning. Upon completing their study journey, users can validate the knowledge acquired through an NFT certificate, which reliably and transparently attests to their mastery of the training content.

Furthermore, Kaisen promotes knowledge sharing, where users, after completing their paths, can make them publicly available with the training content, allowing others to benefit from the journey. To further enrich this exchange, community members can contribute supplementary materials to existing trails, while the trail creator retains the autonomy to accept all, some, or none of the contributions. This promotes active curation and ensures the quality of shared resources.

The Kaisen community plays a central role in collaboration and engagement. If a user needs help developing a trail, they can share their request with the community via a post with just one click. These complaints are posted both in the post area and directly on the trail itself, but clearly state that the trail is open for improvement. When a contribution is made, the trail creator can evaluate it and decide whether to accept it.

The token reward system encourages active participation. Users accumulate tokens by interacting meaningfully—whether by answering questions correctly, completing trails, contributing content, helping other users, or interacting with the community with feedback and suggestions. Additionally, you can earn tokens by recommending a platform to friends using a unique code: new users enter this code when registering, ensuring that those who wish to receive it receive a reward. Posts on the platform's internal Twitter account also earn tokens, encouraging publicity and social participation.

Kaisen also values building digital trust and connections between users. You can access other members' profiles, view their posts, selected tracks, published tracks, and contributions to the community. Clicking on a user's name in any post opens their profile, making it easier to see their history and follow their work.

Finally, to make learning more fun and motivating, earned tokens can be used in the Kai Store—an interactive environment where you can unlock mascot options with exclusive skins, as well as special tools to enhance the learning and content creation experience.

In this way, Kaisen establishes itself as an intelligent, collaborative, and rewarding learning environment—where every achievement is recorded, every contribution is valued, and knowledge is transformed into rewards, recognition, and real rewards.

# 2. Application Overview

## 2.1. Project Scope

### 2.1.1. Porter's 5 Forces Model

The education industry faces growing challenges, such as the low quality of teaching and the difficulty of reliably proving learning. According to UNESCO, millions of young people still do not have access to adequate education, while the job market evolves rapidly and demands constant professional development. In addition, the lack of effective means—digital or physical—to validate knowledge hinders the advancement of many individuals.

In this context, Kaisen emerges as an innovative solution by combining artificial intelligence and blockchain to personalize learning and ensure the secure validation of knowledge through immutable digital certificates (NFTs). By facilitating learning, transparent certification, and collaborative sharing, Kaisen offers an effective alternative to the limitations of the traditional education model, expanding access and trust in the educational process.

In this scenario, Porter's Five Forces analysis is applied—an essential tool for assessing the competitive environment and understanding the factors that influence the dynamics of the sector.

</div>

**Competitor Rivalry – High**<br>
The online education platform market is booming, driven by giants such as Coursera, Udemy, Duolingo, and Khan Academy, which reach millions of users around the world. This diversity of alternatives increases the competition for attention and engagement. To differentiate itself in this scenario, Kaisen adopts a unique proposal: it combines personalized artificial intelligence with immutable validation of knowledge via blockchain. This approach creates a qualitative barrier that reduces the direct impact of traditional competition and positions the platform as a reference in educational innovation.

**Threat of new entrants – Moderate**<br>
The threat of new entrants is moderate because, despite the ease of entry into the digital sector, developing a platform that integrates AI, blockchain, gamification, and knowledge validation requires technical expertise, investment in infrastructure, and educational credibility. These requirements create technological and trust barriers, thus making it difficult for new participants with similar proposals to enter and protecting the position of the Kaisen platform in the market.

**Threat of substitute products – High**<br>
The threat of substitute products is high, as users may opt for informal solutions, such as YouTube videos, e-books, forums, or free podcasts. These alternatives, although accessible, lack pedagogical structure, valid certification, and engagement mechanisms. To overcome this scenario, the Kaisen platform relies on a personalized learning journey based on artificial intelligence and the immutable validation of knowledge through NFTs—a significant differentiator that is not easily replicable by traditional or informal substitutes.

**Bargaining power of customers – High**<br>
Given the wide range of free or low-cost educational resources available, users have a high level of choice and demand clear value in their decisions. To reduce this pressure, Kaisen invests in the user experience by offering a gamified, transparent platform focused on digital reputation through certified NFTs. This value proposition strengthens loyalty, increases engagement, and transforms the user into an active agent in their own educational development.

**Supplier Bargaining Power – Moderate**<br>
Dependence on external technological infrastructure and tools—such as AI APIs and blockchain networks—can increase suppliers’ bargaining power and impact operating costs. To mitigate this risk, Kaisen adopts a service decentralization strategy, prioritizing scalable, interoperable solutions that allow flexibility in choosing partners. With this, the platform ensures technical autonomy and greater resilience in the face of fluctuations in the supplier market.

### 2.1.2. SWOT Analysis of Partner Institution

The SWOT analysis is a widely used tool for planning and mapping out various solutions. It helps in understanding how a company, brand, product, or service positions itself in the market by identifying its strengths and weaknesses (internal factors), as well as opportunities and threats (external factors). Below is the analysis of the developed solution.

<div align="center">

### 2.1.3. Solution

**Problem to be solved:** <br> 
The traditional educational model is centralized, expensive, and inefficient in providing detailed and verifiable proof of individual knowledge. Furthermore, the certificates currently used are fragile, and learning is treated as a product rather than a collaborative ecosystem. Consequently, there is a lack of effective mechanisms for validating knowledge, as well as limited incentives for sharing and collaboration within the community.

**Available data:** <br> 
The platform offers a wide variety of educational content, available in various formats, such as PDFs, articles, research papers, and technical documentation. Furthermore, relevant data is collected, such as user learning patterns and preferences, community engagement metrics, and blockchain-based validation records. It is worth noting that the platform utilizes both user-generated content and learning materials processed by artificial intelligence (AI), thus creating a comprehensive and dynamic knowledge repository.

**Proposed solution:** <br> 
Kaisen is the first decentralized knowledge protocol that transforms learning—once a passive consumption process—into a creative, collaborative, and valuable experience. The solution combines personalized learning paths with AI technologies and blockchain validation, creating a true “GitHub of Knowledge.”

Users insert raw materials (like PDFs, topics, and links), which are processed by Kai, an AI assistant. From this processing, Kai generates personalized learning tracks. If they prefer, the user can also create their track manually. These tracks can be published, forked, and improved by the community, resulting in a living and constantly evolving repository, validated by NFT certificates and incentivized by the $KOIN token economy.

**How to use the solution:** <br> 
- Content Input: The user submits documents or defines topics of interest to Kai.
- Path Generation: The AI, or the user themselves, creates personalized learning paths that include quizzes, flashcards, and interactive content.
- Learning Process: Users progress through the paths with the support of the AI tutor.
- Community Collaboration: Upon completion, paths can be published and improved by the community through forking.
- Validation: Completion of the learning process is certified by “mineable” NFTs, serving as proof of learning.
- Incentive: Users are rewarded with $KOIN tokens for creating quality content, completing paths, and collaborating with the community.

**Expected benefits:** <br>
- Democratization of access to personalized, AI-driven education.
- Verifiable and portable knowledge credentials, secured by blockchain certificates.
- Creation of a collaborative knowledge ecosystem, with content continuously improved by the community.
- Establishment of a sustainable incentive model that values learning and sharing.
- Reduction of educational costs and expansion of access to education.
- Strengthening digital reputation and professional recognition through certified achievements.

**Success criteria and how it will be evaluated:** <br>
- User Engagement: Measured by the number of paths created, completed, and forked monthly.
- Community Growth: Assessed based on the number of active users and retention rate (goal: over 5,000 active users in the first year).
- Knowledge Quality: Verified through community reviews and engagement metrics for published tracks.
- Certification Adoption: Quantified by the number of NFT certificates issued and shared in professional contexts.
- Token Economy Health: Monitored based on the circulation of the $KOIN token, adoption of staking mechanisms, and market activity.
- Educational Impact: Assessed by measuring improvements in user knowledge and skills through pre- and post-assessments.

# 3. Application Project

## 3.1. Architecture Diagram

The application's architecture diagram, as illustrated in the image, was designed with a clear separation between the front-end, authentication, back-end, and external integration layers. This modular structure aims to ensure not only the organization and maintainability of the code, but also security, scalability, and a high-performance user experience. The diagram is, therefore, an essential tool for visualizing the organization of components, facilitating understanding among developers, and guiding technical decisions throughout the project.

<div align="center">

</div>

The front-end represents the layer of direct interaction with the client, built with a set of modern technologies to ensure an efficient interface. The foundation of the interface is developed in React, which allows for the creation of dynamic and reusable UI components. The development process is accelerated by Vite, a high-speed build tool. To ensure the robustness and quality of the code, the project adopts TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript, while styling is managed by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that enables the construction of custom designs in an agile and consistent manner.

The bridge between the user interface and the back-end services is the authentication layer, which adopts a sovereign digital identity approach through Internet Identity and NFID. Unlike traditional systems based on username and password, this method allows users to securely access the application using cryptography and devices with WebAuthn support. This strengthens security, privacy, and the user experience by removing the need to memorize passwords.

The logical core of the application resides in the back-end, which is implemented through Canisters hosted on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. This choice decentralizes the application, making it more secure, transparent, and resistant to failures or censorship. Within this structure, several canisters operate in an orchestrated manner to deliver the platform's functionalities. The users_backend manages user profiles and data; the tracks_backend serves as the central repository for the learning tracks; the chats_backend enables communication and community functionalities; and the nft_certificates, in direct communication with the tracks_backend, is responsible for generating and issuing completion certificates in NFT format, ensuring their authenticity and immutability.

To enhance the application with advanced artificial intelligence, the architecture integrates a cutting-edge external service. The orchestration of this integration is handled by the kai_backend, a specific canister that acts as an intermediary. It receives the raw materials provided by the user (such as PDFs and links) and triggers the Gemini language model, from Google, through secure API calls. Gemini then processes this data to generate personalized learning tracks. This hybrid approach combines the computational power of a large-scale LLM with the security and decentralization of the business logic running on-chain, optimizing the best of both worlds.
 
 This diagram is essential for visualizing the organization of components, facilitating understanding between developers and stakeholders, and guiding technical decisions throughout development.
